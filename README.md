<h1>Tunnelman Game</h1>

To start the game run the TunnelMan.exe file in the Executable directory.

In the game, the player attempts to gather as many points as possible, displayed in the top left corner. 
The player is given 3 lives to collect all the oil barrels within the ground while avoiding enemies to advance to the next stage. 
The gold nuggets provide more points while the sonar is used (pressing the z key) to find the hidden items in the ground. The Water Gun
is used (by pressing the spacebar) to splash an enemy directly in front of the player to either stun or eliminate them. Boulders in the ground
have gravity and can either kill the enemy or the player by crushing them.  

To move: arrow keys or WASD

Splash: spacebar

Sonar: z key
